### Remove Teams from Archive
This project cleans out teams and all team references from a migration archive generated by GHES, prior to being imported on GHEC or another GHES instance. It consists of a shell script that unzips the archive and removes all `team_0000x.json` files, and then calls a node script that parses the other json files to remove any direct references to those teams. To use this solution, take the following steps:

1. Ensure that you have Node and NPM installed on the machine
2. Download or clone this repository
3. Run `npm install`
4. Run `remove-teams-from-archive /PATH/TO/ARCHIVE.tar.gz /DESTINATION/PATH/FOR/NEW/ARCHIVE.tar.gz`
   - NOTE: The destination path is optional. If left blank, the original archive will be replaced with the new archive.
5. Start the import and upload the new archive
